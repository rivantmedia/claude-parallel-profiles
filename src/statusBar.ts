   * in", or the bar happily shows a signed-out account as if nothing happened.
   * Ground truth is the token (file, or Keychain item on macOS) plus the CLI's
   * verdict; the identity is only a fast fallback for the email while the CLI is
   * still answering. (A confirmed `loggedIn` without a token is still trusted —
   * that's an API-key setup, which keeps no OAuth token.) A Keychain that can't
   * be asked is not "no token" either.
   *
   * The three cached states are NOT interchangeable and collapsing them is a bug:
   *   undefined → not asked yet
   *   null      → the CLI could not be run (no `claude` on PATH, timeout)
   *   object    → the CLI answered; `loggedIn` is then the verdict
   * Treating `null` as "signed out" put a warning badge and "Claude: sign in" on
   * a perfectly signed-in window whose only sin was a `claude` binary the
   * extension host couldn't reach. A failed question is not a negative answer:
   * fall back to the files on disk, and just say it isn't confirmed.
