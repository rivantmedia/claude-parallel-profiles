/**
 * Per-window binding of a Claude account.

 * How isolation actually works
 * ────────────────────────────
 * Claude Code resolves its data directory from `process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
 * (verified against the extension bundle: it builds the child env as
 * `{ ...process.env, ...claudeCode.environmentVariables }`). Each VSCode window
 * runs in its OWN remote extension host process, so `process.env` is
 * independent per window. By setting `process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` here, and
 * making sure the machine-scoped `claudeCode.environmentVariables` setting does
 * NOT also define it (that setting would override us), each window can point at
 * a different account simultaneously on a single WSL host.
 *
 * The active account for a window is remembered in workspaceState so it sticks
 * across reloads of the same workspace.
